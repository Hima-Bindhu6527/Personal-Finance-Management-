            <p>
              <strong>
                ETFs are a sort of investment fund that combines the best
                features of two popular assets:
              </strong>{" "}
              They combine the{" "}
              <strong>diversification benefits of mutual funds</strong> with the{" "}
              <strong>simplicity with which equities may be exchanged</strong>.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="definition-section">
            <h2>What is an ETF?</h2>
            <p>
              An <strong>exchange-traded fund (ETF)</strong> is a collection of
              investments such as equities or bonds. ETFs will let you invest in
              a large number of securities at once, and they often have{" "}
              <strong>cheaper fees</strong> than other types of funds. ETFs are
              also more easily traded.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, ETFs, like any other financial product, is not a
              one-size-fits-all solution. Examine them on their own merits,
              including management charges and commission fees, ease of purchase
              and sale, fit into your existing portfolio, and investment
              quality.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="how-works-section">
            <h2>How do ETFs Work?</h2>
            <p>
              The assets that are underlying are{" "}
              <strong>owned by the fund provider</strong>, who then forms a fund
              to track the performance and offers shares in that fund to
              investors.{" "}
              <strong>
                Shareholders own a part of an ETF but not the fund's assets.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Investors in an ETF that tracks a stock index may get lump
              dividend payments or reinvestments for the index's constituent
              firms.

                <h4>Fund Creation</h4>
                <p>
                  An ETF provider takes into account the universe of assets,
                  such as stocks, bonds, commodities, or currencies, and builds
                  a basket of them, each with its own ticker.

                <h4>Share Purchase</h4>
                <p>
                  Investors can buy a share in that basket in the same way they
                  would buy stock in a firm.

                <h4>Trading</h4>
                <p>
                  Like a stock, buyers and sellers trade the ETF on an exchange
                  throughout the day.
