            <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
            <p>
              A cryptocurrency is a <strong>virtual or digital currency</strong>{" "}
              that can be used to buy goods and services; which implies there's
              no physical coin or bill used and all the transactions take place
              online. It uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to
              ensure that online transactions are completely secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is a purely virtual line of currency that runs on the system of{" "}
              <strong>cryptography</strong>. It functions as a decentralized
              medium of exchange where cryptography is used to verify and
              facilitate each transaction. Cryptography also underlies the
              creation of units of different cryptocurrencies.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="crypto-blockchain-section">
            <h3>üîó Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>
              This mode of exchange primarily runs on{" "}
              <strong>blockchain technology</strong> ‚Äì that which lends
              cryptocurrencies decentralized status. It is a{" "}
              <strong>shared public ledger</strong> that contains all the
              transactions that have ever taken place within a network.
              Therefore, everyone on the network can see each transaction that
              takes place and also view others' balances.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Blockchain technology addresses one of the primary concerns
              with digital payment platforms, i.e.{" "}
              <strong>double-spending</strong>
              while ensuring there is no monopoly of authority. That is because,
              in blockchain technology, parties to a transaction themselves
              verify and facilitate every such activity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="crypto-history-section">
            <h3>üìú How was the Idea of Cryptocurrency Conceived?</h3>
            <p>
              The concept of digital currency gained considerable traction in
              the <strong>90s tech boom</strong>. Multiple organizations and
              programmers ventured to create a parallel line of currency that
              would be out of any central authority's reach. However,
              ironically, the companies that tried to create this digital
              currency themselves assumed the authority of verifying and
              facilitating transactions.
            </p>
            <p>
              It not only defeated the purpose but founded the venture as well.
              Moreover, the digital currencies back then were riddled with
              frauds and other financial challenges. For a long time since then,
              this idea of digital currency was considered a lost cause. This
              idea was falsified when <strong>Satoshi Nakamoto</strong> ‚Äì a
              programmer or a group of programmers ‚Äì introduced and explained
              what Bitcoin is in <strong>2009</strong>, the first-ever
              cryptocurrency.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="crypto-how-it-works-section">
            <h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>
            <p>
              According to Satoshi Nakamoto, the founding father of Bitcoin, it
              is a <strong>peer-to-peer electronic cash system</strong>. In
              that, it is much similar to peer-to-peer file transactions, where
              there is no involvement of any central authority or regulator.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ergo, cryptocurrencies are mere transactions or entries in a
              shared ledger that can only be changed upon meeting certain
              prerequisites. Typically, in a blockchain technology like the
              Bitcoin network, each transaction consists of the involved
              parties' ‚Äì sender and receiver ‚Äì{" "}
              <strong>wallet addresses or public keys</strong> and the amount of
              such transaction.

                <h4>1. Transaction Confirmation</h4>
                <p>
                  What attributes the safety net in such a network to avoid
                  fraud is that the sender needs to confirm a transaction with
                  their <strong>private key</strong>. After confirmation, the
                  transaction is reflected in the shared ledger or database.

                <h4>2. Miner Verification</h4>
                <p>
                  However, only <strong>miners</strong> are authorized to
                  confirm transactions within a cryptocurrency network. They
                  need to solve cryptographic puzzles to confirm any specific
                  transaction. In exchange for their service, they receive a
                  transaction fee in that particular type of cryptocurrency and
                  a reward.

              <div className="crypto-step-item">
                <h4>3. Network Update</h4>
                <p>
                  Once miners confirm a transaction, they spread it to the
                  network, and every node in that automatically updates its
                  ledger accordingly. Furthermore, once a miner confirms a
                  particular transaction, it becomes{" "}

                  As a particular type of cryptocurrency gains popularity and
                  more and more miners join the bandwagon, the miners' fees and
                  reward per transaction go down. For instance, initially,
                  miners could get <strong>50 bitcoins (BTC)</strong> as a
                  reward for mining; however, due to the recent halving in May
                  2020, miners' rewards have gone down to{" "}

              the largest market share, has experienced some of the most erratic

            <p>
              Since cryptocurrency is not rooted in any material change but a
