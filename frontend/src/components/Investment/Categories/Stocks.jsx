            <h2>Understanding Stock Market Basics</h2>
            <p>
              All companies need money to run their business. Sometimes the
              profit acquired from selling goods or services is not sufficient
              to meet the working capital requirements. And so, companies invite
              normal people like you and me to put some money into their company
              so that they can run it efficiently and in return, investors get a
              share of whatever profit they make.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding this is the first step towards understanding stock
              market basics.

              Stock investment is a way to invest in some of the most successful

            <h2>What is Share Market?</h2>
            <p>
              People often wonder what is stock market and share market, and
              often use it interchangeably.
            </p>
            <p>
              A stock market is similar to a share market. A share market is
              where the shares are issued or traded in. The primary difference
              between the two is that the <strong>stock market</strong> lets an
              individual trade in bonds, mutual funds, derivatives, shares of a
              company, etc. On the other hand, a <strong>share market</strong>{" "}
              only allows the trading of shares.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="stocks-intro-content">
            <h2>How Does the Stock Market Work?</h2>
            <p>
              Companies raise money on the stock market by selling ownership
              stakes to investors. These equity stakes are known as shares of
              stock.
            </p>
            <p>
              By listing shares for sale on the stock exchanges that make up the
              stock market, companies get access to the capital they need to
              operate and expand their businesses without having to take on
              debt. Investors benefit by exchanging their money for shares on
              the stock market.
            </p>
            <p>
              As companies put that money to grow and expand their businesses,
              it profits the investors as their shares of stock become more
              valuable over time, leading to capital gains. In addition,
              companies pay dividends to their shareholders as their profits
              grow.
            </p>
            <p className="highlight-box">
              üí° <strong>Historical Performance:</strong> The performances of
              individual stocks vary widely over time but taken as a whole, the
              stock market has historically rewarded investors with average
              annual returns of around 10%, making it one of the most reliable
              ways of growing your money.
